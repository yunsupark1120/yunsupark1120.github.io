# Welcome to Python Tutorial!

There are many Human Languages, such as English, Korean, Spanish, Chinese, etc.

Just Like humans, computers also have different languages for communication, such as _C/C++_, _Assembly_, _Java_, _JavaScript_, and _Python_.

## Why Python?

### Interpreter V.S. Compiler

Computers fundamentally only understand languages written with 0 and 1, often referred to as "Machine Language". No matter what language programmers code in, there must be a process of converting that into machine language. This conversion is done by either an interpreter or a compiler.

Two popular examples of these types of languages are C (a compiled language) and Python (an interpreted language). Compiled languages like C usually perform faster, but they can be more difficult to code and debug.

Python, on the other hand, is an interpreted language. This means that it is relatively easy to write and fix errors in Python. The interpreter executes the code line by line, which allows for more immediate feedback and easier debugging. This is one of the reasons why Python is popular for beginners and for rapid development.

### Easy to Learn

Python is easy to learn for several reasons.

1. **Readability**: Python's syntax is designed to be readable and straightforward. This makes it easier for beginners to pick up the language and understand what the code is doing.

2. **High-level language**: Python is a high-level language, meaning it abstracts many of the complex details of the computer. This allows beginners to start coding without needing to understand complex computer science concepts.

3. **Large Standard Library**: Python comes with a large standard library that covers many areas, from web development to machine learning. This means beginners can do a lot with Python without needing to understand or use external libraries.

4. **Strong Community**: Python has a large and supportive community. This means there are plenty of resources available for learning and troubleshooting, from online tutorials to forums and Q&A websites.

For example, these are the codes for printing "Hello World!" in three different languages.

C++

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    cout << "Hello World!";
    return 0;
}
```

Java

```java
public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello World!");
    }
}
```

Python

```python
print("Hello World!")
```
