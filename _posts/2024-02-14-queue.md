**This is a fourth post in Data Structure series.**

## Introduction

A queue is a linear data structure that follows the First In First Out (FIFO) principle. It is similar to a line of people waiting for a bus. The person who comes first will get into the bus first. Just like Stacks, Queue is considered a **Limited-Access Data Structure**. Queue is a similar Abstract Data Type (ADT) to stack, with only difference being the replacement of LIFO (Last In First Out) with FIFO.

## Operations

Queue consists of two main operations.

- **Enqueue**: Adds an item to the queue. If the queue is full, then it is said to be an Overflow condition.
- **Dequeue**: Removes an item from the queue. The items are popped in the same order in which they are pushed. If the queue is empty, then it is said to be an Underflow condition.

### Types of Queue

- **Bounded Queue**: A queue with a fixed size.
- **Unbounded Queue**: A queue with no fixed size.

## Performance

![Performance Chart](assets/img/DataStructure/DataStructurePerformance.jpg)

- Enqueue and Dequeue operations both have a time complexity of O(1).
- Queues are efficient for adding and removing elements, but not for searching or accessing elements in the middle.

Queue is a very useful data structure in programming. It is ideal for scenarios where data is processed in a first come first serve basis.

For example, a call center phone system uses a queue to hold people in line until a service representative is free. The person who has been waiting the longest is the first to be served.

Buffering is another scenario where queue is used. Data is transferred between two devices, and at the receiving end, data is kept in a queue until the device is ready to accept it.

You can imagine a queue being utilized in video streaming services. The streaming device will receive the video data from a server and store it in a queue until it is ready to be displayed.

## Implementation

A common way to implement a queue is to use an array. However, since an array has a fixed size, there is a limitation to implement an unbounded queue with an array. To overcome this limitation, we can use a linked list to implement a queue.

Here is a simple implementation of a queue using a linked list in Python:

```python
class Node:
    def __init__(self, data, next=None):
        self.data = data
        self.next = next

class Queue:
    def __init__(self):
        self.front = None
        self.rear = None
        self._size = 0

    def enqueue(self, item):
        self._size += 1
        node = Node(item)
        if self.rear is None:
            self.front = node
            self.rear = node
        else:
            self.rear.next = node
            self.rear = node

    def dequeue(self):
        if self.front is None:
            raise IndexError("The queue is empty")
        self._size -= 1
        temp = self.front
        self.front = self.front.next
        if self.front is None:
            self.rear = None
        return temp.data

    def size(self):
        return self._size
```

```python
def __init__(self):
    self.front = None # The first element of the queue
    self.rear = None # The last element of the queue
    self._size = 0
```

This is a constructor for the Queue class. It initializes an empty queue, so the first and last elements are set to None, and the size is set to 0.

```python
def enqueue(self, item):
    self._size += 1
    node = Node(item)
    if self.rear is None:
        self.front = node
        self.rear = node
    else:
        self.rear.next = node # The current rear node points to the new node
        self.rear = node # The rear is updated to the new node
```

This is the enqueue method. Becuase the item is added to the queue, the size increases by 1.

A new node is created with the item, and was empty, the new Node becomes the only itme in the Queue. In that case, both the front and rear are set to the new node.

If the queue was not empty, the prior rear node receives a new pointer that links to the new node. After this, the rear is updeated to the new node.

```python
def dequeue(self):
    if self.front is None:
        raise IndexError("The queue is empty")
    self._size -= 1
    temp = self.front
    self.front = self.front.next
    if self.front is None:
        self.rear = None
    return temp.data
```

This is the dequeue method. The size of the queue is decreased by 1.

If the Queue is empty, an error is raised.

If the Queue is not empty, the front node is stored in a temporary variable. After that, the second element in the queue is updated to be the new front.
If the front becomes None after the dequeue, it implies that the Queue is now empty. In this case, the rear is also set to None.
The method returns the data of the original front node, which is unlinked from the queue.

_demonstration_

```python
queue = Queue()
print(f"Size of queue: {queue.size()}")
queue.enqueue(3)
queue.enqueue(5)
queue.enqueue(7)
print(f"Size of queue: {queue.size()}")
for i in range(queue.size()):
    print(queue.dequeue())
print(f"Size of queue: {queue.size()}")
```

    Size of queue: 0
    Size of queue: 3
    3
    5
    7
    Size of queue: 0

In Python, there is a built-in module called `queue` that provides a Queue class. The Queue class uses a linked list to implement a queue. The following code demonstrates how to use the Queue class.

```python
from queue import Queue

q = Queue()
print(f"Size of queue: {q.qsize()}")
q.put(3)
q.put(5)
q.put(7)
print(f"Size of queue: {q.qsize()}")
for i in range(q.qsize()):
    print(q.get())
print(f"Size of queue: {q.qsize()}")
```

    Size of queue: 0
    Size of queue: 3
    3
    5
    7
    Size of queue: 0

## Problem Solving

### 1. Reverse a Queue

Given a queue, reverse it.

```python
def reverse_queue(queue):
    stack = []
    while not queue.empty():
        stack.append(queue.get())
    while stack:
        queue.put(stack.pop())
```

The above code uses a stack to reverse the queue. The queue is emptied and the elements are pushed into the stack. After that, the elements are popped from the stack and pushed back into the queue.

### 2. Create a Queue using Stacks

Implement a queue using two stacks.

```python
class Queue:
    def __init__(self):
        self.stack1 = []
        self.stack2 = []

    def enqueue(self, item):
        while len(self.stack1) != 0:
            self.stack2.append(self.stack1.pop())
        self.stack1.append(item)
        while len(self.stack2) != 0:
            self.stack1.append(self.stack2.pop())

    def dequeue(self):
        if len(self.stack1) == 0:
            raise IndexError("The queue is empty")
        return self.stack1.pop()
```

Stacks add item in the front, while Queue adds item in the rear.

To emulate enqueue method, we need to take out all the items from a stack, add the new item, and then put back all the items in order.

```python
def enqueue(self, item):
    while len(self.stack1) != 0: # while stack1 is not empty
        self.stack2.append(self.stack1.pop()) # take out all the items from stack1 and put them in stack2
    self.stack1.append(item) # add the new item to stack1
    while len(self.stack2) != 0: # while stack2 is not empty
        self.stack1.append(self.stack2.pop()) # take out all the items from stack2 and put them back in stack1
```

To emulate dequeue method, we can simply pop the last item from stack1
This is because both stacks and queues have the item to be removed at the top/front of the data structure.
The only difference is that the candidate for removal was added the most recently in a stack, while it was added the least recently in a queue.
