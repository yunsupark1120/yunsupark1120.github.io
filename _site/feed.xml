      Welcome to Python Tutorial!

There are many Human Languages, such as English, Korean, Spanish, Chinese, etc.

Just Like humans, computers also have different languages for communication, such as C/C++, Assembly, Java, JavaScript, and Python.

Why Python?

Interpreter V.S. Compiler



Computers fundamentally only understand languages written with 0 and 1, often referred to as “Machine Language”....

      Recursion in algorithms is a method where a problem is solved by breaking it down into smaller instances of the same problem. This approach involves a function calling itself with a smaller input until it reaches a condition known as the base case, which is simple enough to be solved directly. Once the base case is reached, the solution to that base case is used to solve the other instances of ...
